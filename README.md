The official chess web-based app of the [BoldChess.com](https://boldchess.com/) website.

It is a responsive web GUI for the Stockfish chess engine with analysis, evaluation, and graphs. It also comes with Leela Chess Zero (LCZero) neural network evaluation.

Note: This app is originally based on [PeshkaChess](https://github.com/hxim/PeshkaChess) and modified for [BoldChess.com](https://boldchess.com/).
